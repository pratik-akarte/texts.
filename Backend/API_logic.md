Imagine a "New User Welcome Desk" at an online service:

The Entry Point (Main Server File -> userRoutes):

Your main application (server.js) says: "Any requests starting with /api/user should go to the userRoutes desk."

app.use("/api/user", userRoutes);


The "Registration Form" Handler (userRoutes -> registerUser controller):

At the userRoutes desk, if someone tries to "submit a new form" (a POST request to the base path /), the registerUser clerk handles it.

router.post("/", registerUser);

The Clerk's Checklist (registerUser controller):

a. Collect Info: The clerk (registerUser) takes the submitted form data: name, email, password, and pic 
const { name, email, password, pic } = req.body;4

b. Check for Completeness: "Are the essential fields (name, email, password) filled out?" If not, reject the form (error 400).
if (!name || !email || !password) { ... }

c. Check Existing Records: "Is this email already in our system?" If yes, tell them they're already registered (error 400).
const userExists = await User.findOne({ email }); if (userExists) { ... }

d. Create New Record: If all checks pass, create a new user file in the filing cabinet (database) using the User template (Mongoose model).
const user = await User.create({ name, email, password, pic });

e. Issue ID Card & Welcome Pack: If the file is successfully created, give the new user their ID (_id), confirm their details (name, email, pic), and a special access token (JWT).
if (user) { res.status(201).json({ ... token: generateToken(user._id) }); }

f. Handle Filing Errors: If something went wrong while creating the file, report a failure (error 400).
else { res.status(400); throw new Error("Failed to create user"); }

[[The "User File" Template (UserModel - Mongoose Schema):]]

This is the blueprint for every user's file. It dictates what information is stored:
name: Must have (String, required)
email: Must have, and must be unique (String, required, unique)
password: Must have (String, required)
profilePic: Optional (String), with a default image if not provided.
timestamps: Automatically notes when the file was created and last updated.
In Short & Memorable Terms:

Route (/api/user): The "User Department."
Controller (registerUser): The "Registration Clerk."
Logic:
Get Data: Clerk takes your info.
Validate: Checks if you filled everything and aren't already a member.
Create: Makes a new user entry in the database.
Respond: Gives you your new ID and an access token.
Model (UserModel): The "Standard Form" everyone fills out, ensuring data consistency.
